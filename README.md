**Abstract:**
DNS is essential for translating domain names into IP addresses but faces security challenges like cache poisoning and spoofing. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) improve security by adding digital signatures, but this increases query processing time, memory use, and network overhead. These performance impacts are significant in distributed systems that require low-latency name resolution. Balancing DNSSECâ€™s security benefits with efficient performance is crucial for high-availability environments. This paper explores addressing DNSSEC-related performance issues using an access control mechanism.

**Key Contributions:**
* Algorithm Development
  Designed and optimized access control delay significantly improves DNS resolution performance by drastically reducing delay impacts compared to DNSSEC, especially in distributed cluster environments.
* Performance Comparison
  Conducted bench marking between DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and Access Control Delay Impact.
* Reserach Leadership
  Led the research and technical implementation , focusing on advancing distributed database through algorithm innovation.

**Relevance & Real-World Impact**

* **Secure and Efficient Resolution:**\
    DNSSEC was used to strengthen authentication and integrity in DNS responses.Access control mechanisms supported performance optimization by reducing verification overhead and enhancing resolution speed in distributed systems.
* **Reduced Resource Consumption:** \
    The integration of access control with DNSSEC led to lower CPU and memory usage during query validation. This optimization helped maintain system stability under high query loads in distributed environments.
* **Academic Recognition :** \
    Recognized in academic analyses and technical evaluations focused on DNS query handling and improvements in distributed system resolution strategies.
* **Educational Impact:** \
    Outcomes incorporated into educational programs and investigative projects, supporting continued academic engagement in container orchestration and the effectiveness of cloud-based systems.
