**Abstract:**
DNS is essential for translating domain names into IP addresses but faces security challenges like cache poisoning and spoofing. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) improve security by adding digital signatures, but this increases query processing time, memory use, and network overhead. These performance impacts are significant in distributed systems that require low-latency name resolution. Balancing DNSSECâ€™s security benefits with efficient performance is crucial for high-availability environments. This paper explores addressing DNSSEC-related performance issues using an access control mechanism.

**Key Contributions:**
* Algorithm Development
  Designed and optimized access control delay significantly improves DNS resolution performance by drastically reducing delay impacts compared to DNSSEC, especially in distributed cluster environments.
* Performance Comparison
  Conducted bench marking between DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and Access Control Delay Impact.
* Reserach Leadership
  Led the research and technical implementation , focusing on advancing distributed database through algorithm innovation.
